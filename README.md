# SOHO Today!

Get latest images from the SOHO archive with a single double-click. You can make animated GIFs too.

If you do any science or whatever with the images, don't forget to credit SOHO! You don't need a shout-out to this repo, but it would be appreciated. (You will get nothing in return though.)
